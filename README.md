In 2018 Navitas Semiconductor announced what they define the worldâ€™s smallest, fastest-charging mobile adapter.
Its schematic is built around a GaNFast power ICs delivering 5x greater power than standard smartphone chargers 
with 2x higher power density.

In the same year, Texas Instruments presented the design of a 70W AC/DC Flyback converter with a power density
of about 30W per cubic inch. Practiacally, this would be a power adapter that is 4 times smaller 
than the 2018 Apple Powerbook wall power adapter.

In this repository you can find an open-source KiCad implementation of a very similar 70W Flyback converter.

## Printed Circuit Board
This is the 2 layer PCB designed.

All major developments into high-desity AC/DC flyback converters are done around fancy GaN Mosfets that are 
not so readly available. For instance, the Texas Intruments TIDA-01622 schematic is built around the Navitas 
Semiconductor NV6117 and the NV6115.

At the time of writing (04/2018) the only GaN Mosfet available to me is the Panasonic PGA26E07BA or the cheaper PGA26E19BA.
Both GaN FET would probably require a driver, the Panasonic AN34092B.

The datasheet of all mentioned components are available in the /PDF folder.
