In 2018 Navitas Semiconductor came up with a very fast GaN Mosfet that enables the design of laptop power
adapters and USB chargers with a power density of 20W/in3 or better.

In the same year, Texas Instruments came up with the design of a 70W AC/DC Flyback converter with a power density
of about 30W per cubic inch. This allows the development of a power adapter that is 4 times smaller 
than the 2018 Apple Powerbook wall power adapter.

In this repository you can find an open-source KiCad implementation of a very similar 70W Flyback converter.
